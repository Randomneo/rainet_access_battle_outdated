board[y][x] => this will represent human understandable chords

* ---------------
When operation with player move should be considired
that each player will have own start at bottom of the board
and enemy for that player will start from top

so on backend frontend data should be transposed corespondently to player

let's default aproach be `player1` will be at the top and `player2` - bottom
(so transposition will be applied for player1)

* set layout
after player done with layout frontend will send

# todo
8 cards in format
{
  type: 'set_layout',
  data: [
    {type: 'card', pos: [x, y]},
    ...
    {type: 'card', pos: [x, y]},
  ]
}

types: ['virus', 'link']

in respond there will be
{
  type: 'action',
  action: {
    type: 'start game',
  },
}

* move
For now special action cards will be skiped

frontend -> {
  type: 'move',
  data: {
    'from': [x, y],
    'to': [x, y],
  }
}

# in future it could be type `special_move`

backend -> {
  type: 'move enemy',
  data: {
    'from': [x, y],
    'to': [x, y],
  }
}

backend -> {
  type: 'reveal',
  data: '<card type>
}

all `game stack` assumptions must be considered separately at frontend and bockend at the moment
